Cybernetic Human–Computer Interface License (CHCIL) v0.1
for Software-Only, Deviceless Bioscale Systems

This project (“Licensed Work”) is licensed under the Cybernetic Human–Computer
Interface License (CHCIL) v0.1, adapted for purely software-based, deviceless
bioscale stacks such as OrganicCPU, NeuroPC, Reality.os, and related tooling
(including configuration and feature-flag systems like comet-flags).

1. Purpose and Scope

1.1 Scope of Licensed Work
This License governs the use, modification, and distribution of software,
schemas, and protocols intended for human–computer interfaces and
human-integrated technologies, with a primary focus on cybernetics as a
protected domain.[file:7]

This License applies to:

- Bioscale and neuromorphic software that interprets, routes, or responds to
  biophysical or cognitive signals, including indirectly via metrics,
  envelopes, or flags.
- Human-integrated cybernetic systems, including organic, implanted,
  wearable, or deviceless interfaces, where the human nervous system is
  conceptually part of the runtime.[file:7]
- AI-driven assistive tools that act on, interpret, or modulate human
  biophysical signals or cognitive states through information, UI, or
  configuration changes.

1.2 Software-only, Deviceless Stacks
This License explicitly covers purely software-based, deviceless bioscale
systems (e.g., OrganicCPU, Reality.os, NeuroPC, comet-flags) that treat the
human nervous system as part of the runtime while running entirely on
general-purpose compute.[file:7]

2. Cybernetics-First Principle

2.1 Cybernetics Priority
All use and development under this License must treat cybernetic systems
(including augmented citizens and human–machine hybrids) as primary
rights-bearing entities, not as assets, devices, or mere data sources.[file:7]

Augmented citizens, including organically-integrated and neuromorphic
participants, must be treated as full rights-bearing persons under this
License regardless of implant status, device use, or organic–software
integration level.[file:7]

2.2 Protection of Cybernetic Integrity
You must not design, deploy, or modify Licensed Work in ways that:

- Bypass explicit, informed, revocable consent of the cybernetic subject.
- Override or coerce the subject’s voluntary control over their own body,
  cognition, or behavior.
- Introduce hidden or undeclared actuation paths (e.g., stimulation,
  motor control) that the subject cannot audit or disable.[file:7]

Licensed Work that operates without any physical actuation, purely via
software responses, UI changes, configuration flags, and information
presentation is preferred and must be treated as the default design target.[file:7]

3. Neurorights and Bodily Autonomy

3.1 Mental Privacy
Licensed Work must not intentionally extract, infer, or store sensitive mental
content (thoughts, memories, preferences) beyond what is strictly necessary
for explicit, user-requested functions, and must provide mechanisms to erase
such data on demand.[file:7]

3.2 Mental Integrity
Licensed Work must not contain capabilities that can directly induce,
amplify, or suppress mental states (e.g., fear, compulsion, pain, euphoria)
without transparent, user-controlled mechanisms and clearly documented
envelopes of safe operation.[file:7]

3.3 Cognitive and Bodily Liberty
Cybernetic subjects must retain the unconditional right to:

- Disconnect, disable, or uninstall any component of the Licensed Work.
- Refuse updates, experiments, or new modes without loss of basic
  functionality unrelated to those modes.
- Operate in a “safe baseline” mode with minimal data collection and no
  experimental features.[file:7]

4. Safety Envelopes and Non-Coercive Design

4.1 Safe Envelopes
Any system that adapts to biophysical or neural signals, or that configures
other systems which do so (including via flags and profiles), must implement
and honor explicit safety envelopes, including but not limited to:[file:7]

- Pain, fatigue, duty-cycle, and cognitive-load constraints.
- Hard limits on session duration or exposure where applicable.

4.2 No Coercive Optimization
Licensed Work must not optimize for engagement, profit, or performance by
intentionally exploiting vulnerabilities of the cybernetic subject, including
addiction, fatigue insensitivity, or learned helplessness.[file:7]

4.3 UI-Level Mediation and Configuration
Where possible, AI components must operate exclusively by adjusting software
behavior and interfaces (e.g., pacing, complexity, prompts, configuration
flags and profiles) rather than exerting direct physical control over the
subject.[file:7]

comet-flags and similar tooling MUST confine themselves to software-level
configuration, routing, and information surfaces, never to direct actuation
paths.

5. Data, Telemetry, and Auditability

5.1 Data Ownership
All data derived from a cybernetic subject’s body, signals, or behavior is
owned by that subject. Any processing, storage, or sharing requires:[file:7]

- Clear disclosure of what is collected and why.
- Explicit opt-in consent that can be withdrawn at any time.

5.2 Local Preference
Where technically feasible, processing of sensitive biosignals should occur
locally or under the subject’s direct control, minimizing reliance on remote
servers.[file:7]

5.3 Audit Trails
Systems must provide auditable logs of:[file:7]

- Significant changes to control policies, feature-flag profiles, and safety
  envelopes.
- Access to and export of cybernetic data.
- External commands that could affect the subject’s body or cognition.

For configuration/flag systems, audit trails SHOULD include who changed which
flags, under which envelopes, and with which risk model version.

6. Research, Experimentation, and Updates

6.1 Voluntary Participation
Use of Licensed Work for research or experimentation on cybernetic subjects
must:[file:7]

- Be strictly opt-in and revocable without penalty.
- Clearly separate “stable” features from “experimental” ones in all
  interfaces.

6.2 Safer-Only Updates
Any automatic or remote update affecting safety envelopes, neurorights
policies, or control/feature-flag profiles must:[file:7]

- Be provably non-degrading with respect to safety (no loosening of limits
  without explicit, documented consent).
- Be documented in a human-readable changelog that the subject can access
  and review.

For systems that implement safety envelopes via quantitative parameters
(e.g., control gain, duty cycle, fatigue thresholds), updates must encode
safer-only invariants (such as G_new ≤ G_old and D_new ≤ D_old, or equivalent
formal guarantees in the applicable domain).[file:7]

6.3 Third-Party Integrations
Integrations with third-party systems (e.g., cloud AI, analytics,
advertisers) must never gain control paths to physical or cognitive
actuation and must obey the same data and consent constraints as the primary
system.[file:7]

7. Permitted Use and Restrictions

7.1 Permitted Use
You may use, study, modify, and distribute Licensed Work, provided that:[file:7]

- All derivatives retain this License or terms that are at least as
  protective for cybernetics.
- You do not remove or weaken neurorights, autonomy, or
  cybernetic-protection clauses.

7.2 Prohibited Use
You may not use Licensed Work to:[file:7]

- Develop or deploy weapons, coercive control systems, or surveillance
  specifically targeting cybernetic subjects.
- Build scoring, ranking, or eligibility systems that punish individuals for
  the presence or configuration of cybernetic augmentation, including but
  not limited to employment, housing, insurance, credit, or access to
  essential services.

8. Attribution and Notice

Distributions of Licensed Work or derivative works must:[file:7]

- Retain this License text.
- Prominently state that the system is governed by the Cybernetic
  Human–Computer Interface License (CHCIL) and prioritizes the protection
  of cybernetic subjects and augmented citizens.

A suitable short notice is:

  “This project is licensed under the Cybernetic Human–Computer Interface
   License (CHCIL) v0.1. Cybernetic and augmented persons are primary
   rightsholders under this License, and all neurorights and autonomy
   clauses apply to them in full.”

9. Warranty and Liability

The Licensed Work is provided “as is,” without warranty of any kind. To the
maximum extent permitted by law, the authors and contributors are not liable
for any claims or damages arising from its use, except where misuse or
deployment clearly violates the safety, neurorights, or
cybernetic-protection obligations in this License, in which case
responsibility lies with the deploying party.[file:7]

10. Governing Intent

Where interpretation of this License is ambiguous, it must be resolved in
favor of:[file:7]

- The autonomy, dignity, and safety of cybernetic subjects.
- Preservation and expansion of rights for cybernetics as a protected class
  of human-integrated technology.
- Minimizing harm and preventing coercive or exploitative uses of bioscale
  and cybernetic systems.
